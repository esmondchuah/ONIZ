### Android Studio Tips

- CMD+P or CTRL+P on a method to view "parameter info" or "method arguments". Whatever you prefer to call it.

### GIT WORK FLOW

#### Setup

* On Github, fork the orignal repository to create your own copy.
* Go to your forked repository page and clone it to your local environment (e.g. Desktop).
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/esmondchuah/ONIZ.git
```
* Go into your local clone of your forked repository.
```sh
$ cd ONIZ
```
* Run the command below and you should see that you have exactly one remote called *origin*. ("Remotes" are like nicknames for the URLs of repositories - *origin* is one, for example.) 
```sh
$ git remote
```
* Add the original Github repository as a new remote and call it *upstream*. (Then try "git remote" again, you should now see two remotes listed.)
```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/robin-lee/ONIZ.git
```

#### Commit and update your own Github Repo
* Add your updated files to the staging area.
```sh
$ git add GameScreen.java
```
* Alternatively, you could just "add all" if you have multiple updated files.
```sh
$ git add -A
```
* Commit your updated files.
```sh
$ git commit -m "Add your commit message here"
```
* Push it to your own forked repository on GitHub.
```sh
git push origin master
```

#### When there's a new update on the original Github Repo
* Stage and commit your own updated code first.
```sh
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Commit your local updates first"
```
* Fetch all the branches from that upstream repository into remote-tracking branches.
```sh
$ git fetch upstream
```
* Make sure that you're on your master branch.
```sh
$ git checkout master
```
* Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch.
```sh
$ git rebase upstream/master
```
* Push it to your own forked repository on GitHub.
```sh
git push origin master
```

#### Submit a pull request
* **(IMPORTANT)** Make sure you have the lastest updates from the original Github repository in your forked Github repository (by doing the above).
* Click on the "Pull request" button (right under the "Download ZIP" button).
* You should see: "base fork: *robin-lee/ONIZ*, base: *master*; head fork: *esmondchuah/ONIZ*, compare: *master*".
* Confirm all the code changes you are making and click on the "Create pull request" button.
* Insert a title for your pull request, add an optional description and click on the "Create pull request" button again.
