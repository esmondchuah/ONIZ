# ONIZ (Oh No Its Zombies)

ONIZ is a fast-paced zombie survival game, built using the libGDX game development framework and customised gesture recognition algorithms.

The game is available in single-player and multiplayer mode. The latter is played in an antagonistic mode (versus mode). Zombies have a rock with a gesture pattern on them. Players will have to draw patterns displayed on zombies to kill them before they reach the top of the building. In multiplayer mode, as player kills the zombies, the same number of zombies will also be spawned on the opponentâ€™s screen.
